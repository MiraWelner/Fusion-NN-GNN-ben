This codebase contains the GNN I am creating for Dr. Ben Vaughn at the McGowan Institute of Regenerative Medicine

It predicts the future behavior of heartrate data which is converted from RR wavelenghts to BPM, and ECG signals.

The data is processed by running `process_data.py` and the model is trained by running `train_network.py`.
